## Branching Strategy
- **Master Branch:** Contains production-ready code.
- **Develop Branch:** For ongoing development.
- **Feature Branches:** Each developer creates a feature branch for individual tasks.

Example:
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

## Pull Requests
- Create pull requests from feature branches to the develop branch.
- Review code changes, provide feedback, and suggest improvements before merging complex functionality.

Example:
git pull-request

## Handling Conflicts
- GitHub notifies about conflicts during the pull request process.
- Resolve conflicts by communicating with your teammate and adjusting code accordingly.
