## Branching Strategy
- **Master Branch:** Contains production-ready code.
- **Develop Branch:** For ongoing development.
- **Feature Branches:** Each developer creates a feature branch for individual tasks.

## Pull Requests
- Create pull requests from feature branches to the develop branch.
- GitHub notifies about conflicts during the pull request process.

1. **Initialize a Git repository:** Start by navigating to your WordPress theme directory in your command line interface and run `git init` to initialize a new Git repository.

2. **Create a new branch:** Before making any changes, create a new branch to work on your feature. For example, `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`.

3. **Make changes to your theme:** Now you can make changes to your theme files, such as modifying CSS styles, adding new template files, or updating PHP functions.

4. **Stage your changes:** Use `git add <file>` to stage the changes you want to include in the commit. For example, `git add style.css` to stage changes to your CSS file.

5. **Commit your changes:** Once you've staged your changes, commit them to your local repository with a descriptive message using `git commit -m "Added new feature"`.

6. **Push changes to a remote repository:** If you're working with a team or want to back up your changes, push your branch to a remote repository like GitHub or Bitbucket with `git push origin feature/new-feature`.

7. **Review and merge changes:** After pushing your changes, create a pull request on your remote repository's website. Your team members can review the code, provide feedback, and merge the changes into the main branch when ready.

8. **Update your local repository:** Once your changes are merged, switch back to the main branch with `git checkout main` and pull the latest changes from the remote repository with `git pull origin main`.

9. **Delete your feature branch:** After merging your changes, you can delete your feature branch locally with `git branch -d feature/new-feature` and remotely with `git push origin --delete feature/new-feature`.
